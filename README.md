# Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock

The classic rock, paper, scissors games including the variation of lizard and Spock. You can vs a bot or let the bots play alone!

## Getting Started

The project was made in HTML, CSS and JS. You can see a live previeww [here](https://valkiriann.github.io/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/)

### Prerequisites

This game was made for Chrome 68, but It was tested also in Safari 11.1.2 and in Firefox 62 with good compatibility and no issues. It is also compatible with the newer smartphones and tablets, it was tested in an Ipad Air 2, an Ipad pro, an Iphone 6 and a Xiaomi Mi A1, with no issues. However it is not compatible with browsers that don't support ECMASCRIPT 6 because the project uses string templates and some features that are not compatible with older versions.

## Running the tests
