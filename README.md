### Prerequisites

This game was made for Chrome 68, but It was tested also in Safari 11.1.2 and in Firefox 62 with good compatibility and no issues. It is also compatible with the newer smartphones and tablets, it was tested in an Ipad Air 2, an Ipad pro, an Iphone 6 and a Xiaomi Mi A1, with no issues. However it is not compatible with browsers that don't support ECMASCRIPT 6 because the project uses string templates and some features that are not compatible with older versions.

## Design

When I was thinking about my target, I imagined a range of 18 - 45 for the age. A casual gamer that likes to play on the phone when he/she has some spare time. I choose flat design for the main rule of the style.

I used a chromatic range of blues to inspire calm and relax. The object of the game is to just enjoy a simple mechanic when you want to disconnect a little from your daily rutine.
